Keep track of file changed for refactoring and modification to do.

File changed
=============
 * main.cpp. Note: Keep the name AnimationWindow instead of MainWindow
 * animationwindow.h and animationwindow.cpp. Note: Use unique_ptr instead of ptr for m_openglwindow.


Changing files (still work to do)
=============



To-do list
============
 * Need to change the texture class and constructor to use a QImage instead of a QString and check thath the QImage is not null
